Started at ~1:30
-linux is pain, I just started and spent half my session on solving unnecessary problems, use windows folks, use windows ~2:00
-I feel excited to work at company using local network, It looks cool ~3:20
-this have taken far too long 4:35
-so here I almost done my tutorial for today 5:10
-I almost deleted this diary but GIT saved the day 5:33
=============================================================================================
Day 2 - Ruby First Day
> First I will create a git branch to avoid multiple commits
> Ok dozens of trouble
> Ruby & Python are similiar (great to me)
> The most important feature of ruby is "on rails" framework
> https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/introduction 
    > History
    > Abstration idea
    
    > Ruby Installation

- I feel excited for this course it seems great 2:41PM
- I messed with a lot of things, and now Odin project tells me to not do anythings, well but you told me to follow those other guides 3:30PM
- Here I am done 3:36PM
=============================================================================================
Day 3 - Ruby Day Two
> General non-useful arithmatics :)
> ruby symbol
    > ":my_symbol"
> nil
    > the same as null
> variables are as Python
    > constants are defined by all-captilized letters
    > global are precseded by $ sign
    > class variables are precseded by @@ signs
    > instance variable declaration are preseded by @ sign
    > local variable is defined by name only
> in ruby, when a variable is assigned to another, it will get a pointer to it, not just a copy
    > here: "name1=name2" name1 will hold name2 not only a copy of data at moment of assigning
> taking input:
    gets.chomp
> scope of variables 
    > local defined between {} or do/end
    > global defined away form {} or do/end

> output
    > "print" displays output with "\n"
    > "puts" as "print" wihtout "\n"

> input
    > "gets", returns the inputed string with "\n"
    > "gets.chomp", returns the input without the "\n"
    > tutorials point webpage "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_input_output.htm"
        > "The class IO provides all the basic methods, such as read, write, gets, puts, readline, getc, and printf"
            > "puts" simple output with auto newline
            > "gets" a function returning user input including newline character
            > "putc" instead of put-sting it will put-character
            > "getc" similar to getc but takes one character only
            > "print" similar to puts, but discardes the newline character

            > there is some file opening and closing, but I am not interested yet

> if condition
    > similar to python, ended with "end" command word
    > in ruby a single statement can be conditioned with "if" placed after it 
    > "elsif" & "elese"
    > "unless" command word
        > it is a not if, easy
> Case statement
    > look at this code
    {
        grade = 'F'

        did_i_pass = case grade
            when 'A' then "hell yeah!"
            when 'D' then "also hell yeah!"
            else "McDonald's is hiring!
        end
    }
    > here the text after "then" is assigned to "did_I_pass"
    > or a more classical approach is 
    {
        grade = 'F'

        case grade
        when 'A'
            puts "Hell Yeah!"
            someotherfunction
        When 'D'
            puts "run"
        else
            puts "go to fast food delievery"
    }

> Ternary Operator
    > similar to C/C++ "?" command, but I am not that much interested
- I am getting sleepy, a lot I will end this session early on 3 PM 2:00Pm
- Okay, I am going to commit, push and sleep 2:53PM

Day 4 - Today I will finish (inshallah) basic ruby chapter
(well I did not)

- A website I will do nearly
    - similar to "tesla cars" as front-end
    - hosting on raspberry pain
    - appling embbeded programming to send messages
    - create another web app to print google location URL as QR code
    - create data collector for further data analysis

Day 8 - Files & Serialization
> The IO class 
    > in I/O class we have I/O streams
        > mainly the std ones
        > but we can overwite them
        > $stdout.puts "some string"
    > to create a new object we need a file descripter
        > 1 stands for stdout
    > to get the file descriptor we use the method sysopen
        > "f_desc = IO.sysopen("stream location", "<stream mode>")
        > then we can use the "IO.new(f_desc)"
    > we have a "black-hole" I/O stream called "null"
        > located in "/dev/null"
        > it returns "nil" for input
    > all changes in I/O are not saved until the stream is closed
    > attempting to change closed stream will raise "IOError"

    > "file.pos"
        > it will return the number of characters read
    > "file.eof?"
        > it will return true when reach the end of file
    > "file.rewind"
        > return the cursor to the beginning of the file
    > "io.puts"
        > not destructive
        > output arguments to the stream

    > SubClasses

        > tempfile
        > disparate APIs
> Serialization 
    > the problem raise when we need to transfer data like arrays and structures
    > we may use JSON (hey telegram used it)
    > YAML
    > XML
> Serializing and Deserializing objects
    > choose
        > YAML for human readability and small data size
        > JSON for less human readability and fast speed 
        > Marshel for High speeed
    > check serializer.rb for code

Day 8 - file I/O 
> check file.rb for code
> File.open vs. open
    similar to $stdout.puts and puts
