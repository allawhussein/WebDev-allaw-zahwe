            > I miss
                > Form Submit Button

                > Checkboxes
            > 10% of the program
        > Basic CSS
            > I miss
                > Negative Margin
                > Notion to specify padding and margin 
                > custom CSS variable
                > media query
            > 9% of the program
        > Applied Accessibility
            > I know almost nothing

            > media query
            > retina image for higher resolution
            > Responsive Typography

> So here I set up I will start with the missing skills from first two subsets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Basic HTML and HTML 5
    > radio buttons
        > I did not get it well especially the label & id part
    > general input
        > <label for="input-id">
            <input id="input-id" type="input-type">
          </label>
    > input fields
        > value attribute: it is the value returned to server upon submission
        > name attribute: it is the name returned to server upon submission
        > the server will recieve a name and its value
        
- I paused to help my father a bit 6:56PM
- free code camp offer a built-in code editor, no need to vscode with it
- Stopping for Praying 7:34
- freecodecamp is case sensitive 10:44PM
- Time to commit and move to javascript
=========================================================================================================================
Day 2 - Still General Revision
> CSS variables
> Browser fallback
> Media Query
------------------------------------
I am done with Basic CSS, now with 
Day 2 - Applied Visual Design
- This section is highly important and new
- I enjoyed today's session

> Visual Balance: text-align Property
    > "text-align: justify|center|right|left;"
        > center, will use same amount of spaces on both sides
        > justify, will add spaces in between words so that they stretch to the boundaries
        > left & right, are self-explantory

    > "width: xyzpx|%|vh|wv"
    > "height: xyzpx|%"
    > "font-weight: bold|" <=> <strong>
    > "text-decoration: underline" <=> <u>
    > "font-style: italic;" <=> <em>
    > "text-decoration: line-through;" <=> <s>
    > hroizontal line <hr>
    > "background-color: rgba(red, green, blue, opacity);"
    > "font-size: xypx;"
    > "box-shadow: <offset-x> <offset-y> <blur-radius> <sqread-radius> <color>;"
    > "opacity: <number 0 to 1>;"
    > "text-transform: lowercase|uppercase|capitalize|initial|inherit|none;"
    > "line-height: <number px>;" the height of each individual line
    > Hover State of Anchor Tag
    > Relative Position
        > this will let us move the element away from it's position without affecting other elements
        > you may use "top: <number px>" to move element down by number
        > set "position: relative;"
        > other commands "bottom|left|right"
    > Absolute Position
        > the element is movable but the flow of CSS does not take it into consideration
        > other things are similar to relative position
    > Fixed Position
        > similar to absolute, but uses browser border as reference
        > fixed element won't move with scroll
        > offset properties are relative to screen browser border
    > float Property
        > floated elements are removed from document flow
        > floated elements are either pushed left or right
    > z-index property
============================================================================================
Day 4 - Applied Visual Design

- Today I made an invisible navbar
- after seeing the animation capability of CSS, I think making a game is no foreseen

> change positin of overlapping elements
    > use "z-index"
        > higher values are shown first
> horizontal center
    > use "margin: auto"

> complementary colors
    > the color wheel is based on hue and saturation
        > red and cyan
        > green and magenta
        > blue and yellow

        > color tables are 
            > RGB computer screens
            > CMY(K) printing cartidges
            > RYB (basic physical colors)
> Tertiary Colros
    > combing two primary colors (R+B) creates a secondary color (magenta) that is complementary to the primary color not used to create that secondary (here magenta and green)
    > instead of two complementary colors
        > split-complement scheme
            > base color + 2 adjacent to the complementary
> Adjust the Hue of color
    > see the website for full explanation

> Adjust the tone of color

> CSS Linear Gradient
    > "linear-gradient(<gradient_direction>, <color1>, ...);"
    > with repetition
        > "repeating-linear-gradient(<gradient_direction, <color1> <number_of_px>, <color2>, <number_of_px>, ...)
> pattern background
    > set a small picture as background
    > background support url()

> CSS Transform 
    > transfrom property with scale function
    > "transform: scale(<ratio of scaling>);"
        > this command will scale the size of the element
    > skewX|skewY function 
        > "transform: skewX(<angle_of_skew>deg);"
        > this is not rotation, it will rotate the y-axis of the element while conserving the x-axis
    > rotate 
        > obvious

> CSS graphic
    > well, we did a tranparent shape with a colored shadow
> Complex CSS graphics
    > "::after" & "::before" pseduo-elements
        > they should have the "content: ;" property

> CSS @Keyframes
    > used to animate elements
    > we have 8 animation properties
        > animation-name, which is used by @Keyframes
        > animation-duration
        > animation-iteration-count (it can be infinite)
        > animation-timing-function
            > have 4 values
                > ease - default (slow-fast-slow)
                > ease-out (fast-slow)
                > ease-in (slow-fast)
                > linear
    > @Keyframes
        > they set how animation goes on a 100 step interval
        > code
        {
            #anim 
            {
                animation-name: colorful;
                animation-duration: 3s;
            }

            @keyframes colorful 
            {
                0% {
                    background-color: blue;
                    }
                100% {
                    background-color: yellow;
                    }
            }
        }
        > you can prevent the animation from resetting
            > "animation-fill-mode: forwards;" inside the CSS element not the Keyframe
        > top, bottom, right, left properties can be animated for fixed and relative position
    > Bezier Curves
        > control animation timing better than animation-timing-function
        > it sets 4 main points for animation-timing-function
            > "animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(<x1>, <y1>, <x2>, <y2>);"
