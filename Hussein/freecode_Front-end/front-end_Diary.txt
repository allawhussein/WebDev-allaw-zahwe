I am done with Basic CSS, now with 
Day 2 - Applied Visual Design
- This section is highly important and new
- I enjoyed today's session

> Visual Balance: text-align Property
    > "text-align: justify|center|right|left;"
        > center, will use same amount of spaces on both sides
        > justify, will add spaces in between words so that they stretch to the boundaries
        > left & right, are self-explantory

    > "width: xyzpx|%|vh|wv"
    > "height: xyzpx|%"
    > "font-weight: bold|" <=> <strong>
    > "text-decoration: underline" <=> <u>
    > "font-style: italic;" <=> <em>
    > "text-decoration: line-through;" <=> <s>
    > hroizontal line <hr>
    > "background-color: rgba(red, green, blue, opacity);"
    > "font-size: xypx;"
    > "box-shadow: <offset-x> <offset-y> <blur-radius> <sqread-radius> <color>;"
    > "opacity: <number 0 to 1>;"
    > "text-transform: lowercase|uppercase|capitalize|initial|inherit|none;"
    > "line-height: <number px>;" the height of each individual line
    > Hover State of Anchor Tag
    > Relative Position
        > this will let us move the element away from it's position without affecting other elements
        > you may use "top: <number px>" to move element down by number
        > set "position: relative;"
        > other commands "bottom|left|right"
    > Absolute Position
        > the element is movable but the flow of CSS does not take it into consideration
        > other things are similar to relative position
    > Fixed Position
        > similar to absolute, but uses browser border as reference
        > fixed element won't move with scroll
        > offset properties are relative to screen browser border
    > float Property
        > floated elements are removed from document flow
        > floated elements are either pushed left or right
    > z-index property
============================================================================================
Day 4 - Applied Visual Design

- Today I made an invisible navbar

> change positin of overlapping elements
    > use "z-index"
        > higher values are shown first
> horizontal center
    > use "margin: auto"

> complementary colors
